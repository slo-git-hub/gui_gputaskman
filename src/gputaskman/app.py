# What can be known about GPU memory?

Press **m** (or click **Slim/Full** in the footer) to switch between full diagnostics
and slim monitoring. Slim hides hardware identifiers and secondary telemetry details;
live readings, charts, processes, inspection, and provenance/availability warnings stay visible.
This display-only choice applies to all GPUs and resets to full when the app restarts.

| Layer | Source | Works for |
|---|---|---|
| **Device** telemetry | NVML, AMD ADL, or optional AMD SMI; amdgpu or Intel (i915) sysfs on Linux | availability varies by GPU and driver |
| **Per-process** VRAM, spill to RAM, per-engine load | Windows WDDM counters (dxgkrnl); DRM fdinfo for amdgpu or Intel (i915) on Linux | workloads visible to WDDM or DRM |
| **Which runtime** (CUDA, HIP, Vulkan, D3D12, ggml, ONNX, PyTorch...) | DLLs mapped in the process | everything |
| **Which model file** | memory-mapped files + command line | llama.cpp, stable-diffusion.cpp, LM Studio, Ollama |
| **Model name & kind** (LLM, decision, embedding, speech) | GGUF header, Ollama/LM Studio/Hugging Face stores, local server APIs | GGUF family |
| **Weights / KV cache / compute** split | GGUF header math, llama.cpp/Ollama logs, local server APIs | GGUF/llama.cpp family |
| Per-texture / per-buffer names | needs a debugger (PIX, Nsight) attached to the app | games, 3D apps |

**Evidence** shows how a model was identified: `api` (the runtime says it is loaded), `mapped`
(Windows shows the file mapped into the process right now), `cmdline` (a launch argument only).
Two sources, including `api` or `mapped`, is shown as *confirmed*.

**Local workloads only:** inference, decision models, vision, speech, training, graphics and video.
Cloud-hosted models are outside this monitor's scope. DLLs identify runtimes, not models or tasks.
`decision?` / *likely decision model (name)* is a filename or model-folder hint when a specific
GGUF kind is missing. It does not confirm the kind, GPU residency, or execution. Installed
candidates remain unproven; engine activity is measured per process, not per model.

**Linux / WSL:** on native Linux, per-process VRAM and SM/encoder/decoder load come from NVML
(no spill or commit counters exist there, so those columns stay blank). **AMD GPUs on Linux**
(`amdgpu`) use sysfs for the device and DRM fdinfo (`/proc/<pid>/fdinfo`) per process: VRAM,
GTT (GPU memory in system RAM, shown as SPILL), and gfx/compute/video engine time (`n/a` for a new client's
first sample and for ROCm/HIP processes: their compute runs on `/dev/kfd` queues the kernel doesn't time per
process). VRAM and SPILL are charged to a process only when its DRM clients are provably private: one holder,
opened through a render node, and no shared buffers. Otherwise they show `n/a` and the bytes stay unattributed;
the inspector still shows the resident bytes it can reach (shared buffers included, so not added up). **Intel GPUs
on Linux** (`i915`) take the same path: sysfs for the device, fdinfo for engine load and, on a discrete Arc, local-memory
VRAM. An integrated GPU shows engine load only (VRAM `n/a`), `xe` cards are detected but their per-process fdinfo isn't
decoded yet (rows show `n/a`). With no device-wide memory counter, an Intel card's VRAM used is a sum over the processes
it can inspect (shared buffers can be counted twice; kernel-owned memory and uninspectable processes are missing), its total is
the size of the card's local-memory PCI window (an estimate), and free memory is not shown. Only processes you can inspect are
listed, and the header says how many it couldn't; run with `sudo` to see other users'. Under **WSL**, Windows
charges all Linux GPU memory to the VM (`vmwp.exe`), so VRAM and load are device-wide only; rows
are Linux processes with `/dev/dxg` open and show `n/a` rather than a made-up share. When WSL
interop is enabled, the Windows host's counters are read through `powershell.exe`: **WSL VM**
(`vmwp.exe`) is then the exact total of Linux GPU memory, and Windows apps appear as `W:<pid>`
rows. `--no-host` turns this off. Linux rows get their VRAM by matching the VM's GPU contexts
(newest first) to Linux processes: `*` when candidates agree on the size, `?` for a heuristic owner.
Cached foreign sizes only help rank guesses; they never prove ownership across runs.

**Why does nvidia-smi say N/A?** GeForce cards on Windows run in *WDDM* mode: Windows, not the
NVIDIA driver, owns video memory, so NVML can't attribute it to processes. The Windows counters can.

**dwm.exe looks huge elsewhere?** Windows' per-process "Dedicated Usage" counts every surface a
process can *see*, so dwm can show nearly the whole card. VRAM here is what's charged to each
process ("Local Usage" when available). The adapter counter is the total, not the sum of rows.

**SPILL** = GPU-accessible system RAM. This can include pinned host buffers or intentional
allocations, not just overflow. Large usage under VRAM pressure can indicate fallback;
the counter alone does not prove it.

**PAGED** = max(Total Committed - Local Usage - Non Local Usage, 0). This is an estimate of
non-resident committed memory, not a measured eviction count or proof of pagefile activity.

**Inside** labels are inferred from runtimes and files. Log sizes describe allocated buffers,
not necessarily current residency. A game's textures cannot be enumerated here.

**GPU%** = busiest engine (like Task Manager). On GeForce/WDDM, CUDA kernels are usually reported
on the **3D** engine. AMD device GPU charts show graphics-engine activity, which is not
necessarily equivalent to NVML GPU utilization. Vulkan does not expose another process's HIP internals.

**System panel, RAM and CPU% columns** are reported by the OS (`NtQuerySystemInformation` on Windows,
psutil elsewhere), not by the GPU. RAM is a process's working set, shared pages included, so rows can add up
to more than the machine uses; CPU% is its share of the whole machine, like Task Manager. This is system memory:
it is never GPU bytes and never added to a GPU total. `n/a` means the OS wouldn't say (or it is a Windows-side
row seen from WSL); `…` means one more sample is needed. Inside WSL they describe the Linux VM.
`--no-system` hides them.

Keys: `↑/↓` select · `s` sort · `c` chart · `a` show all · `p` pause · `?` this help · `q` quit

All eight trend charts are visible by default. They stack in narrow terminals and
share rows when there is room. Click the **Charts** dropdown to show all charts or
one metric; `c` cycles the same choices. A blank sample means no reading; zero is
drawn at the baseline. Percentage charts use 0–100%, temperature uses 0–120°C,
and the power and SM clock scales are shown below the charts. In short terminals,
scroll the dashboard or inspector without losing the process list.
